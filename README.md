### Hello, World! I'm Martin PeckðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer at heart, and an engineering manager by trade. I work for Microsoft, in the UK, where I manage a team of excellent engineers.

I've used many programming languages but have fallen in love with Python.

You can find me in various places. I'm `martinpeck` in most places. On <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@martinpeck">Mastodon</a> I'm `@martinpeck@fossodon.org`

My [Linktree](http://linktr.ee/martinpeck) lists the rest.
